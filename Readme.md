# raylibdemo - Spatial Partition Pattern

A simple raylib project to demonstrate the "Spatial Partition Optimization Pattern" by following the example from:
`https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/spatial-partition.html`

## Usage

Before you start the programm change `NUM_CELLS` and `CELL_SIZE` in `grid.h`, which is located in `src/headerfiles`, to one of the four values, which are commented of to the side of the constants. You can also experiment with the values to get different results.

### Controlls

Spawn amount of the objects is set by pressing the `arrow key up or down`.
Press the `left mouse button` anywhere on the screen to spawn objects.
The programm can be closed by pressing the `ESC` key or by pressing the `window close button` on the top right of the screen.
